The AI engineer successfully transformed a discarded codebase into a robust Trending Content Detection System. Initial setup involved environment configuration and resolving Python dependency issues and Pydantic v2 incompatibilities. The core ML system was built with an Adaptive Random Forest Classifier, dynamic trend memory, and KServe V2 API compliance. After extensive debugging of data types and server reloading issues, a functional system with prediction, update, and statistics endpoints was achieved, including a training script.

Subsequently, the engineer migrated to a Dual-Model System supporting both classification and regression. This involved creating model abstraction layers, a regression model, an evaluation module, and extensive updates to the model manager, API endpoints, synthetic data generator, and classifier to use embedding-only input. Comprehensive testing confirmed dual-model functionality.

Finally, an Automated Concept Drift Evaluation System was implemented, featuring drift simulation, periodic feedback, and visualization tools. The latest task involves implementing a UI, starting with backend API extensions, where three files for UI-specific API models and drift testing have been created.

<product_requirements>
The project initially required building a Trending Content Detection System from scratch, including ML components (Adaptive Random Forest, dynamic trend memory), KServe V2 compliant API, and synthetic data generation. The system needed real-time trend prediction, continuous learning, and model persistence.

The first major upgrade was to a Dual-Model System Migration. This demanded integrating both 3-category classification and new continuous regression models, ensuring configurability via YAML for model types, evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²), and training/inference paths. Feature handling specified using only embedding vectors as model input, with velocity metrics solely for target generation. APIs needed dynamic model selection and consistent responses. Synthetic data generation was updated to output embeddings, velocity, and correct target/category.

The next requirement was an Automated Concept Drift Evaluation System. This involved designing a test scenario with a trained model, timestamped embedding sequences, periodic feedback, and simulated concept drift. Visualization was crucial, plotting prediction error, true vs. predicted trends, and showing model recovery. The system had to be fully automated, repeatable, configurable, and save results.

Currently, the task is to implement the TrendDetector UI as per a technical document, starting with backend extensions.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with implementing the TrendDetector UI, based on the  document. The plan outlined was to first implement the necessary backend extensions, followed by the React frontend.

The current work directly involves the initial phase of these backend extensions. The engineer successfully created three new files within the  directory:
-   : This file initializes the  API sub-package.
-   : This file is intended to define Pydantic models for request and response schemas specific to the UI's API interactions. These models will structure the data exchanged between the frontend and the backend for UI-driven features.
-   : This file is designed to contain the API endpoints that will expose the concept drift evaluation system's functionality to the frontend. This would allow the UI to trigger drift tests, configure them, and retrieve their results for visualization.

This marks the very beginning of the UI integration, setting up the API layer that the frontend will interact with to utilize the already built dual-model TrendDetector system and its drift evaluation capabilities. The specific logic for these endpoints, particularly within  and , is yet to be fully implemented.
